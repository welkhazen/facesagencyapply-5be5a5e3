# ⚠️ ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Missing Environment Variable

## The Problem

I've tested your production API and found the root cause:

```
❌ Status: 401 Unauthorized
❌ Error: "Authentication credentials not found"
```

**The `HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable is NOT set in Vercel.**

This is why nothing is being submitted to HubSpot - the serverless function doesn't have access to your HubSpot token.

## The Fix (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Add Environment Variable to Vercel

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:** https://vercel.com/dashboard

2. **Select your project:** `facesagencyapply-5be5a5e3`

3. **Navigate to Settings:**
   - Click **Settings** tab
   - Click **Environment Variables** in left sidebar

4. **Add the variable:**
   - Click **Add New** button
   - **Key:** `HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN`
   - **Value:** `pat-eu1-741e9cfb-a2a4-4efd-9fac-b2971fad7a6a`
   - **Environments:** Check ALL three boxes:
     - ✅ Production
     - ✅ Preview
     - ✅ Development
   - Click **Save**

5. **Redeploy:**
   - Go to **Deployments** tab
   - Click on the latest deployment
   - Click the **"..."** menu (three dots)
   - Select **Redeploy**
   - Wait 1-2 minutes for the deployment to complete

### Step 2: Test Again

After redeployment, run this command:

```bash
node test-hubspot-api.js https://facesagencyapply-5be5a5e3.vercel.app
```

You should see:
```
✅ SUCCESS!
🎉 Contact created with ID: [number]
```

### Step 3: Verify in HubSpot

1. Go to https://app.hubspot.com
2. Navigate to **Contacts** → **Contacts**
3. Search for "APITest Script"
4. You should see the test contact

### Alternative: Use the Web Interface

1. Go to: https://facesagencyapply-5be5a5e3.vercel.app/debug-hubspot
2. Click **"Test Serverless API (Production)"**
3. You should see ✅ SUCCESS with a contact ID

## Why This Happened

- Your `.env` file has `VITE_HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN` (with `VITE_` prefix)
- This prefix makes it available to the **frontend** during build
- But the **serverless function** needs `HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN` (without prefix)
- Vercel serverless functions don't have access to `VITE_*` variables
- Environment variables must be added separately in Vercel's dashboard

## Verification

Once fixed, you'll know it's working when:

1. ✅ Test script returns "SUCCESS! Contact ID: [number]"
2. ✅ Contact appears in HubSpot immediately
3. ✅ Form submissions from the website work
4. ✅ All data is synced to HubSpot

## Current Status

- ✅ Code is correct and deployed
- ✅ API endpoint is working
- ✅ All debugging tools are in place
- ❌ **HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable is missing in Vercel**

**👉 Add the environment variable and redeploy, then test again!**

---

## Summary

**Problem:** Missing `HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN` in Vercel environment variables

**Solution:** Add it in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables → Redeploy

**Expected Result:** HubSpot submissions will start working immediately

**Time to Fix:** ~2 minutes

Let me know once you've added the variable and I'll help verify it works!
